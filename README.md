Cloning
-------

To clone this repository use:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs

To clone the submodules if you have previously cloned DDNet-rs without them, or if you require the full history instead of a shallow clone:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Building
--------

In order to build DDNet-rs you need the latest stable rust compiler and a c compiler:

- Visit https://rustup.rs/ to install rust, make sure rust is up to date `rustup update`
- Inside the project directory open a terminal and type `cargo run --release`

Features
--------

Some features require you to compile DDNet-rs with explicit features:

```bash
cargo run --release --features bundled_data_dir,ffmpeg,microphone,enable_steam
```

- `ffmpeg` enables the demo to video recorder on supported platforms. [Linux]
- `bundled_data_dir` bundles the whole data directory into the executable, making it very portable, but much bigger.
- `microphone` enables the microphone backend which allows features like spatial chat.
- `enable_steam` enables steam support, the resulting binary has to be executed inside a steam runtime to work.

Android
-------

```bash
# using https://github.com/rust-mobile/xbuild
x build --release --arch arm64 --platform android --format apk -p ddnet-rs --features bundled_data_dir
```

AI Usage
-------

Using AI is totally fine, but as powerful as these tools are, they are probability machines and differently than humans have much less self reflection and cannot learn on the fly. Even if they are 90% correct, they rarely are 100% correct. Human review for correctness and code quality by the developer that uses these tools is a must! Maintainers cannot do the heavy work for you.
